# Python Blackjack

## Description

This is my first Python project. A simple, text-based Blackjack game programmed in Python.

I'm using this project to wrap up things I learnt about Python and to learn how it works in practice.


## How to play
Just run the main.py script and use the terminal to play. The game is text based


## Features
This is a simple game. As of now, there is no betting system and graphical interface.
