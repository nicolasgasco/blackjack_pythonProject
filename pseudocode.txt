# 1. Generate a deck of 52 cards
I originally did this with a list of tuples ((suit, number, value)) and sticking to it at the moment.

# 2. Deal two cards to the player (face up) and two to the dealer (only one face up).
Did it with first hand.
	2a. If dealer's card is 10 or ace, check if it's natural

# 3. Check for naturals (10 + ace), both for player and dealer
	3a: It can be a TIE, one of the WINS or a pass

4. Stand or hit
# 	4a. Player stands: you keep the two cards and dealer can keep playing.
		4a1: IF SUM >= 17: Dealer stands. (11 has precedence over 1)
		4a2: IF SUM < 17: Dealer hits
			4a3: repeate hitting
		4a4: CHECK WINNER

# 	3b. Player hits: you get another card
		3b1: Bust!
			Dealer wins
		3b2: IF NOT BUST: You get another card: 
				  You stand (LOOP)
