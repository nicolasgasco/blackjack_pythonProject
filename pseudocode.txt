# 1. Generate a deck of 52 cards
I originally did this with a list of tuples ((suit, number, value)), but I now upgraded to dictionary

# 2. Deal two cards to the player (face up) and two to the dealer (only one face up).
Did it with first hand.

# 3a. Player stands: you keep the two cards and dealer can keep playing.
	3a1: Dealer stands.
	3a2: Dealer hits.
		Outcome: you win, dealer wins, PUSH
# 3b. Player hits: you get another card
	3b1: Bust!
		Dealer wins
	3b2: You get another card and is compared to those of the dealer
		3b2-a: You can get another card. (Up to 5-6)
			Outcome: you win, dealer wins, PUSH



Cards given --> Player hit or stand --> if hit: received cards --> Busted or not -> if not: who wins
					if stand: no more cards --> Dealer buster or not --> if not: who wins
